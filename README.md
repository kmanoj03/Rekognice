# 📂Significance of the Folders?
- _face_images_ : This directory has the images of all the students who have registered themselves.
- _inapp_images_ : This directory has the images usef to enhance the beauty of the UI.
- _read_ : This directory has the code to print the details of various text/binary files used by the app.
- _Excel_ : This directory has the different Excel spreadsheets sorted class wise along with a excel file of the failed attempts.

# 😛Bonus
The app is kind enough to greet you where ever it can. Turn the volume up and get ready xD.

# ？Requirements
Please check this [requirements.txt](https://github.com/manoj-jojo/Rekognice/blob/main/requirements.txt) file. Apart from that download the community version of [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=17), since the log files of the same are required for the face recognition.

# ‼️Note
**Please modify the paths of various files according to your system**

# 🔭Scope
The app can be used as an alternative to the traditional method of taking attendance in a classroom.

# 🔺Improvements
This code (with more powerful recognition) can be integrated with a CCTV camera which is there in the campus (preferably in the entrance) so that attendance can be taken on a large set of students. The manual work of entering the USN by the students can also be bypassed by writing better code. 

# ❌Limitation
In case if the user is sitting in a place such that very less amount of light falls on his/her’s face, the recognition might not happen or might take time.
