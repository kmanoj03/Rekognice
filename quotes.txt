The world is full of nice people. If you cannot find one, be one.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
Great things never come from comfort zones.
Success does not just find you. You have to go out and get it.
The harder you work for something, the greater you will feel when you achieve it.
Do not stop when you are tired. Stop when you are done.
Wake up with determination. Go to bed with satisfaction.
It is going to be hard, but hard does not mean impossible.
Do not wait for opportunity. Create it.
The key to success is to focus on goals, not obstacles.
